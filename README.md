### Babysitter Service App
This project is a babysitter service application for a company offering nanny services. The application consists of three pages: Home, Nannies, and a private Favorites page. The application provides functionality for user authentication, viewing and managing a list of nannies, and adding nannies to favorites. The application is built with modern web technologies and follows the requirements specified in the technical assignment.

### Features
 Home Page: Includes the site title, company slogan, and a link that redirects to the Nannies page.
Nannies Page: Displays a list of nannies with sorting and filtering options by name, price, and popularity. Users can load more nannies by clicking a button.
Favorites Page: Private page that shows the nannies added to favorites by the user.
User Authentication: Allows users to register, log in, view current user information, and log out using Firebase Authentication.

# Nanny Information: 
Each nanny card contains detailed information about the nanny, including name, avatar, birthday, experience, reviews, education, kids age, price per hour, location, about, characters, and rating.

# Favorites Management: 
Users can add nannies to favorites and the state persists across sessions. Non-logged-in users receive a notification that the functionality is available only for authenticated users.
# Appointment Form: 
Users can make an appointment with a nanny through a modal form with validation.
